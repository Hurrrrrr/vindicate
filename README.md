Blind wine tasting practice app

This is my first independent coding project. Doubtless there are many best practices not practiced.
The original implementation is done in Python because I prefer working in it and I wanted to learn
how to use Python to build a webapp.

Technologies/skills which are new to me for this project:
    using and manipulating SQL in Python
    using GPT4 for coding assistance
    porting a project from Python to WebApp

GPT4 was used primarily for input on the architectural design of this app, as well as
writing some repetitive code such as the getters in the Wine class. The vast majority
of code was written by hand.
