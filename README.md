Blind wine tasting practice app

This is my first independent coding project. Doubtless there are many best practices not practiced.
The original implementation is done in Python because I prefer working in it and I wanted to learn
how to use Python to build a webapp. I've written this code to favour readability over performance,
since I intend to use this as a portfolio piece.

New-to-me technologies/skills which I learned for this project:
    software architecture design
    CRUDing SQL in Python
    using GPT4 for coding assistance
    porting a project from Python to webapp
    adding Gaussian noise to data to produce normally-distributed randomness

GPT4 was used primarily for input on the architecture of this app, as well as
writing some repetitive code such as the getters in the Wine class. The vast majority
of code was written by hand.
